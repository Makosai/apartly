# Apartly

A new and exciting way to rent apartments with ease.

## Development

First run `npm install` before anything else.

Install and run locally (http://localhost:5173):

```sh
npm run dev
```

Build and preview (http://localhost:4173):

```sh
npm run build && npm run preview
```

Build and host for production (http://localhost:3000):

```sh
npm run build && node build
```

You can pass a `HOST=127.0.0.1` and `PORT=80` if you want to change the IP and port.
